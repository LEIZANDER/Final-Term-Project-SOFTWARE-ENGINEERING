# Final-Term-Project-SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING

Purpose of the software: 
All software development process is applied is Planning, Implementing and Testing except for Maintenance.

Why we chose agile:
We chose agile because of its profound lack of error which means more flexible and making it a more easier to capture the customer's needs so that the customer is satisfied 
with the end result.
In agile, it is easier to make changes or adding to fit and satisfy customer's needs. Customers' will feel more involve knowing that we have taken them into account.                                                      
Target Market:
The target audience is for all ages young, old, etc meaning it's free for everyone to play.                                   

Software development plan:                                                                                                                                                   
The development process starts with the idea we all came up with 'The horse game' it is a game where a horse jumps up and down with no end at sight unless if it touches the cactus you lose. Survival of the fittess is the key.The main idea is to get a highscore compare with other people.     

Testing:
We have selected 10 people at random to particapate in the game and see if any changes should be made (Bugs). After getting the result,we decided to take into account of what the participants want to change.           

Memebers:
We have a total of 4 members. 

Schedule:


Algorithm:  


Status:
The status of the software is completed. 

Future Plan:
In the near future, we plan on improving the graphic image of the game.
